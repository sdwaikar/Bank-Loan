Description: This repository hosts a Data Analyst Portfolio Project focused on the finance domain, specifically analyzing bank loan data. The project encompasses data querying, analysis, and visualization to monitor and assess lending activities, providing insights into loan performance and aiding strategic decision-making.

Features:

SQL Queries: Utilizes SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for robust data querying. All queries are pre-validated in SSMS to ensure accuracy.
Data Visualization: Leverages Excel for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to bank loans, including total loans, funded amounts, and repayment rates. Despite the availability of advanced tools like Tableau and Power BI, Excel is employed for its accessibility and proficiency in handling dynamic data slicing and ease of use for users not familiar with more complex BI tools.
Comprehensive Dashboards: Includes multiple dashboards highlighting various aspects of loan data such as loan status, borrower demographics, and loan purposes, enabling a thorough understanding of the bankâ€™s portfolio.
Repository Contents:

Dashboard.xlsx: Contains the data visualization dashboards, including the design sheet, summary dashboard, and overview dashboard.
Domain Knowledge.docx: Provides essential background information to understand the data and its implications in the financial domain.
Problem Statement.docx: Outlines the objectives and requirements of the data analysis to guide the visualization process.
Query Doc.docx: Includes SQL queries and their results for data extraction and validation.
Terminologies in Data.docx: Explains key terminologies used within the data, enhancing understanding and accuracy in data handling.
Importance of the Project: Understanding bank loan data is crucial in the finance sector as it helps in risk assessment, decision-making, and regulatory compliance. Analyzing this data aids banks in identifying trends in loan uptake and repayment, which can influence future lending decisions and strategies for financial products. Moreover, knowledge of different loan statuses like 'Good Loans' vs. 'Bad Loans' provides critical insights into the financial health of the lending institution.

Why Excel for Visualization? While tools like Tableau and Power BI offer advanced functionalities for interactive dashboards and large-scale data manipulation, Excel remains a valuable tool for visualization due to:

Ubiquity and Familiarity: Excel is widely used in the finance industry, making it accessible to a broad audience without the need for additional training.
Detailed Analysis: Excel allows for detailed and precise calculations which are essential for financial data analysis.
Integration: Easily integrates with other Microsoft Office tools, which are prevalent in business environments.
By providing a detailed analysis through a familiar platform, this project facilitates deep insights into lending practices, helping to optimize financial strategies and improve loan outcomes.

Summary Dashboard
This dashboard provides a high-level summary of the bank's lending activities, with a focus on overall loan statistics and the categorization of loans as either 'Good' or 'Bad':

Total Loan Applications: Reports a total of 38.6K applications with a month-to-date (MTD) increase of 4.3K and a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 6.9%.
Total Funded Amount and Total Amount Received: Displays the amounts disbursed ($435.8M) and received ($473.1M) by the bank, highlighting the MTD and MoM changes, suggesting an active lending and repayment cycle.
Good vs. Bad Loans: Distinguishes between 'Good Loans' (86.18% of applications, resulting in $370.2M funded) and 'Bad Loans' (13.82% of applications, resulting in $65.5M funded), showcasing the bank's ability to manage risks effectively.
Interest Rates and Debt-To-Income Ratios (DTI): Average interest rate of 12.05% and an average DTI of 13.33%, offering insights into the cost of borrowing and the financial health of borrowers.

Overview Dashboard
This dashboard provides a deeper dive into the bank's loan operations, analyzing data based on various dimensions such as time, geography, and borrower characteristics:

Monthly Trends: Illustrates the distribution of loan applications over the year, useful for identifying seasonal patterns in lending activities.
Geographic Distribution: Uses a filled map to show loan applications by state, helping identify regional market dynamics and potential areas for market penetration or risk exposure.
Loan Term and Purpose: Breaks down loans by term and purpose (like debt consolidation, credit card refinancing), which can help in tailoring products to meet borrower needs.
Employee Length and Home Ownership: Examines the correlation between employment length and loan applications, and categorizes loans by home ownership status (rent, own, mortgage), providing a nuanced view of borrower stability and market segments.
Each dashboard serves specific strategic purposes:

The Summary Dashboard offers executives and decision-makers a quick glance at key financial indicators and risk metrics.
The Overview Dashboard provides operational insights and detailed analyses, which are essential for department heads and managers responsible for day-to-day operations and strategic planning.
These dashboards are invaluable tools for the bank, enhancing data-driven decision-making, improving risk management, and tailoring services to meet customer needs more effectively.
